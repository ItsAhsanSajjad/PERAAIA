                "text": "PERA – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) General Information\n• What is PERA?\nThe Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (PERA) is a provincial authority established under the Punjab Enforcement and Regulation Act, 2024. It is a body corporate created to enforce and regulate specified laws across Punjab. PERA’s mandate is to carry out the purposes of the Act – essentially coordinating enforcement of various regulations for public welfare in the province.\n\n• For more information visit: https://pera.punjab.gov.pk/\n• Who are the members of the PERA Authority?\nThe Authority is high-level and multi-disciplinary. It is chaired by the Chief Minister of Punjab and includes top provincial officials (e.g. the Chief Secretary as Vice Chair, Senior Member Board of Revenue, and Secretaries of Home, Finance, Local Government, etc.), the Provincial Police Officer (IG Punjab) as member, three members of the Punjab Assembly (including one woman), four independent experts from the private sector, and PERA’s own Director General (who acts as Member/Secretary). These members collectively form the governing body of PERA.\n\n• For more information visit: https://pera.punjab.gov.pk/authority-composition\n• What laws does PERA enforce (what are “Scheduled laws”)?\nPERA is responsible for enforcing Scheduled laws, which are the specific laws listed in the Schedule of the PERA Act, 2024. These typically include various provincial statutes related to public order, safety, and regulations (e.g. laws on encroachments, public nuisances, land, municipal regulations, etc.). In essence, the “Scheduled laws” are those acts or rules that PERA is empowered to implement and enforce as per the Act. Legal Authority and Functions\n\n• Under what law is PERA established and what is its legal authority?\nPERA is established by the Punjab Enforcement and Regulation Act, 2024 (Act XI of 2024). This Act provides PERA with broad powers to “take such measures as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of the Act”. In simple terms, PERA’s legal authority comes directly from this Act, which empowers the Authority to make rules/regulations and to act as the lead enforcement body for the specified laws in Punjab.\n\n• For more information visit: https://pera.punjab.gov.pk/legal-framework",

                "text": "to comply with the easier, civil enforcement steps. Compliance with PERA’s notices and orders early on can prevent such outcomes and keep the matter out of criminal courts.\n\n• Q: How can I report a violation or nuisance to PERA?\nA: If you’re a member of the public wanting to report an issue (like an illegal encroachment in your area or a public nuisance affecting your community), you can file a complaint to PERA. The law allows any aggrieved person or even a concerned bystander to report a public nuisance or encroachment to the Enforcement Officer or relevant PERA office. You may contact your local Enforcement Station (PERA office at the sub-division level) or use any official complaint channels PERA provides (such as a hotline or online portal, if available). When you report, give as many details as possible (location, nature of the problem, people involved, etc.). PERA will then investigate, whereby, PERA official will likely inspect the site, and if the issue falls under PERA’s mandate, they will take action (issuing notices or orders to the offender as described earlier). Reporting is encouraged because it helps the authority identify and address violations that affect the public. There are also whistle-blower protections in the Act – if you report in good faith, your identity can be kept confidential to protect you. Just ensure that the complaint is genuine; knowingly filing a false complaint is itself punishable.\n\n• Q: What are the consequences for a PERA officer if they misuse their authority?\nA: PERA not only enforces rules on the public, but also holds its own officers accountable under the law. If a PERA officer misuses power or acts corruptly, there are provisions to address this. Members of the public can file a grievance or complaint to the Grievance Redressal Commissioner (or the District Board) if they believe an officer has abused their authority. Internally, PERA Act Section 47 makes “misuse of authority by an employee” an offence that can be met with fines (up to Rs. 100,000). In serious cases, the officer could also face departmental disciplinary action or even criminal charges (if laws are broken). PERA officers must act within the law as the system has checks to prevent abuse. This helps ensure that enforcement actions are fair and not personal or arbitrary. If you suspect wrongdoing by an officer, you should report it through the proper channels so it can be investigated.",

                "text": "Chapter II: Recruitment 2.1 Selection Process PERA recruits employees through a transparent, merit-based selection process that aligns with organization’s specific needs. The goal is to attract qualified candidates and ensure fairness and equal opportunity in hiring. The Admin Wing, in coordination with relevant Directors, will determine staffing needs and obtain approval for recruitment from the Competent Authority. Each position will have a clear job description outlining duties, required qualifications, experience, and competencies. The whole process of recruitment will be strictly followed as per relevant service regulations. All records of the recruitment process (scores, applications, decisions) are kept on file for audit and in case of any appeal or review. No hiring shall be made on the basis of canvassing, personal favor, or pressure; any attempt to unduly influence the recruitment process by a candidate or insider is grounds for candidate’s disqualification and possible disciplinary action for the insider. Recruitment of relatives (nepotism) is also handled carefully: if a candidate is an immediate relative of a current PERA employee or Board member, this must be disclosed to avoid conflict of interest (and such an employee may recuse from the selection process). In summary, the selection process at PERA is designed to be fair, competitive, and based on merit. This ensures that the Authority brings in competent individuals of integrity, which is essential for an organization entrusted with enforcement and regulatory duties. 2.2 Candidate Onboarding Onboarding is the process of integrating a newly hired employee into PERA and equipping them with the information and tools needed to become effective and comfortable in their role. PERA’s onboarding process is thorough and formal, reflecting our structured environment. The following steps are involved once a candidate has accepted the offer of employment: • Documentation and Appointment Formalities: The selected candidate is required to submit necessary documents for HR records and verification. These typically include: academic degrees/certificates (in original for verification and photocopies to keep on file), experience letters from previous employers, national identity card (CNIC) copy, passport-size photographs, Police Character Certificate etc. Candidates must also submit a medical",

                "text": "Chapter II: Recruitment 2.1 Selection Process PERA recruits employees through a transparent, merit -based selection process that aligns with organization’s specific needs. The goal is to attract qualified candidates and ensure fairness and equal opportunity in hiring. Th e Admin Wing , in coordination with relevant Directors, will determine staffing needs and obtain approval for recruitment from the Competent Authority. Each position will have a clear job description outlining duties, required qualifications, experience, and competencies. The whole process of recruitme nt will be strictly followed as per relevant service regulations. All records of the recruitment process (scores, applications, decisions) are kept on file for audit and in case of any appeal or review. No hiring shall be made on the basis of canvassing, personal favor, or pressure; any attempt to unduly influence the recruitment process by a candidate or insider is grounds for candidate’s disqualification and possible disciplinary action for the insider. Recruitment of relatives (nepotism) is also handled carefully: if a candidate is an immediate relative of a current PERA employee or Board member, this must be disclosed to avoid conflict of interest (and such an employee may recuse from the selection process). In summary, the selection process at PERA is designed to be fair, competitive, and based on merit. This ensures that the Authority brings in competent individuals of integrity, which is essential for an organization entrusted with enforcement and regulatory duties. 2.2 Candidate Onboarding Onboarding is the process of integrating a newly hired employee into PERA and equipping them with the information and tools needed to become effective and comfortable in their role. PERA’s onboarding process is thorough and formal, reflecting our structured environment. The following steps are involved once a candidate has accepted the offer of employment:\n\n• Documentation and Appointment Formalities: The selected candidate is required to\nsubmit necessary documents for HR records and verification. These typically include:\nacademic degrees/certificates (in original for verification and photocopies to keep on file), experience letters from previous employers, national identity card (CNIC) copy, passport- size photographs, Police Character Certificate etc. Candidates must also submit a medical",

Employees must follow evacuation plans, attend safety drills, and report emergencies to designated persons.\n\n• Workplace Safety: Employees must observe general safety practices, report hazards, and\navoid behavior that could cause accidents. Use of hazardous or flammable materials requires prior authorization for official purposes only.\n\n• Information Security: Staff must secure official data and devices in line with IT policy.\nPasswords must be kept confidential, and sensitive information should not be shared in public areas. Loss or theft of data or equipment must be reported immediately.\n\n• Security Incidents: Any incidents such as theft, break -ins, or threats must be reported to\nthe Admin Wing. Investigations will be conducted and employees are expected to fully cooperate. By adhering to these security measures, employees help create a secure environment for everyone. Management will regularly review and update security protocols in response to any changing threat assessments or after-action reviews of incidents. Any suggest ions from employees on improving workplace security are welcomed. 4.4 Gender Equity and Diversity PERA is committed to fostering a work culture that supports gender equity and diversity. PERA strives to be a model workplace for gender inclusion and sensitivity. PERA ensures that job advertisements encourage women to apply. The harassment prevention mechanisms are rigorously implemented to ensure women feel safe at work. PERA ensures that women have equal access to training, professional development, and advancement opportunities. There shall be no “glass ceiling” – female employees are encouraged to pursue leadership roles and will be considered for promotions on equal footing with male colleagues. Any implicit bias or stereotyping that could hinder women’s progression is actively discouraged. Under this policy, discrimination on the basis of gender (or any identity) is strictly prohibited (this complements the EEO policy). Through these measures, PERA not only aligns with national and provincial commitments to gender equity but also leverages the strengths that a diverse workforce brings. A gender-balanced and inclusive organization is more innovative, effective, and attuned to the needs of the public it serves.",
