This includes performance evaluations, any pending disciplinary proceedings, and general conduct. Deputation is usually only accepted for officers who have a clean service record. PERA’s stance is that the integrity of personnel is non-negotiable. While we trust employees, we also verify. This ensures we maintain a workforce that the public and stakeholders can trust, which is critical in an enforcement and regulatory context. 2.4 Probation Period All initial appointments in PERA – whether of regular or contractual employees – are subject to a Probation Period. The probationary period allows the organization to evaluate a new hire’s performance, conduct, and overall fit for the job, and likewise gives the employee time to understand the role and expectations. The policy for probation is as follows: • Duration of Probation: A person appointed to a regular/permanent position typically undergoes a probation of minimum one (1) year from the date of joining, or as decided by Director General. If the employee’s performance is not satisfactory within this period, the probation may be extended once. For contractual employees, the probation period is usually shorter – commonly three (3) months or six (6) months, as specified in the contract agreement. The exact period for contract staff will be stated in their contract letter. • Probation Terms: During probation, the employee’s work performance, conduct, punctuality, and general suitability are observed and assessed by their immediate supervisor and concerned Director. Clear objectives or key performance indicators (KPIs) should be communicated to the probationer early on (as part of onboarding). Regular feedback should be given to help the probationer improve. Being on probation does not mean the employee is not fully subject to all rules – all policies of PERA apply to probationers as well. However, a probationer does not enjoy the same job security as a confirmed (permanent) employee, making it easier to discharge them if needed. • Confirmation Process: Shortly before the end of the probation period, the HR Department will remind the concerned supervisor to submit a Probation Evaluation Report.

At the end, the Inquiry Officer/Committee writes an inquiry report with findings on whether each charge is proven or not. This report goes to the competent authority, who then makes a decision. If the charges are proven, the competent authority decides on an appropriate penalty from the list of penalties and issues an order in writing. Throughout this, the employee has the right to a defense and to be heard in person if they request. The goal of the procedure is to ensure that no one is punished without evidence and an opportunity to explain their side, as per PERA’s regulations and general principles of due process.\n\n• Can a PERA employee appeal a disciplinary decision?\n\nYes. PERA employees have the right to appeal against disciplinary penalties. The Efficiency & Discipline Regulations designate an Appellate Authority for each type of employee (often a higher official or committee, as listed in Schedule-I of the regulations). If an employee is aggrieved by the punishment ordered by the competent authority, they can file a departmental appeal to the Appellate Authority. The appeal must usually be submitted within a certain time frame (commonly 30 days from the order). The Appellate Authority will review the case, which may include re-examining the evidence or considering any new facts, and then pass an order – either upholding the original decision, modifying the penalty, or overturning it. Beyond the departmental appeal, PERA’s regulations also allow a revision in certain cases[69], which is another review (often by the highest authority or the Authority Board) if there is some glaring issue or illegality in the orders of the lower authorities. It’s worth noting that during appeal, the implementation of the penalty may be paused or it may continue – depending on the rules and the discretion of the appellate authority. Also, even after exhausting internal appeals, an employee could seek judicial remedy (e.g., in Punjab Service Tribunal) as per general service laws. But within PERA’s framework, yes, there is an internal appeals process to ensure no disciplinary action is final until a higher authority has had a chance to review it, if the employee so requests. Recruitment and Conditions of Service\n\n• How does PERA recruit its employees?\n\nPERA follows a merit-based recruitment process for hiring. When there are vacancies, these are typically advertised publicly (in newspapers or online) to invite applications. Candidates go through a selection procedure that can include written tests, interviews, and background checks. The selection is designed to be fair and transparent. A Selection Panel/Committee assesses the candidates against the required qualifications and competencies for the role. PERA places emphasis on hiring people with relevant skills and a good track record, often preferring candidates with understanding of the “Scheduled laws” and needed technical abilities (for enforcement roles, physical fitness and integrity are important as well).

                "text": "• Q: Under what circumstances will PERA register a case with the police?\n\nA: PERA refers cases to the police primarily in instances of serious, wilful, or continuing violations. Some specific scenarios include:\n\n• Obstruction or Violence: If someone attacks, threatens, or seriously obstructs a\n\nPERA enforcement team, an FIR will likely be lodged immediately for obstructing official duties. This ensures the offender can be arrested and the behavior is dealt with under criminal law.\n\n• Repeat or Egregious Violations: If an individual or business keeps flouting the law\n\n– for example, repeatedly setting up an illegal encroachment after removal, or continuously creating public nuisances, in all such cases, PERA may decide to involve the police. Repeated non-compliance shows intent, and a criminal case can be registered to deter further violations.\n\n• Failure to Comply with Orders: When someone outright refuses to comply with\n\nan Absolute Order or an EPO (and especially after being given opportunities through notices and hearings), the SDEO can file an FIR to enforce the law. Essentially, if you ignore PERA’s administrative penalties, they will switch to criminal enforcement.\n\n• Other Offences under the Act: Certain violations (like those involving fraud,\n\nimpersonation, or other criminal behavior) might be handed to police directly. Also, if PERA uncovers a violation of a law outside its immediate scope while enforcing (say, a criminal act under another law), it can coordinate with police to address that.\n\n• In all these cases, PERA works with the police to ensure the offence is prosecuted.\n\nOnce an FIR is registered, the matter goes into the criminal justice system where the police investigate and the courts adjudicate the offence. Remember, the vast majority of compliance issues won’t reach this stage if you cooperate; FIRs are a last resort for serious breaches of the law.\n\n• Q: What are the consequences if a case is referred to the police?\n\nA: If your violation gets referred to the police via an FIR, it means the issue has escalated beyond administrative fines. Consequences include: possible arrest, as offences under PERA are cognizable (you can be arrested without warrant). You will have to deal with a criminal case, the police will investigate, and you might have to appear in court. If found guilty by the court, you could face criminal penalties which might include imprisonment or additional fines, depending on the offence (for example, obstructing public servants or other penal code violations carry jail terms). Moreover, having an FIR/court case is itself a hassle – it consumes time and resources, and being non-bailable under the Act means you might not get immediate bail. In short, once a case goes to police, the matter becomes much more serious: your freedom could be at stake aside from just monetary penalties.

                "text": "defined jurisdiction (often corresponding to a sub-division or district) where PERA’s enforcement team operates. In practical terms, it functions somewhat like a police station but for PERA enforcement officers – it’s the base from which Enforcement Officers, SDEOs, Sergeants and other staff carry out operations in that area. Complaints are often lodged at the Enforcement Station; enforcement teams deploy from there to conduct inspections, raids, and other activities. Each Enforcement Station is headed by a Sub-Divisional Enforcement Officer (SDEO), who supervises the Enforcement Officers and sergeants in that station’s jurisdiction. The station maintains registers of inspections, seizures, etc., and coordinates with the District Enforcement and Regulatory Board (DERB) for that district. For the public, the Enforcement Station is the most accessible face of PERA. It’s where you might go to submit a complaint or respond to a notice. PERA plans to have multiple Enforcement Stations across Punjab, so that enforcement of scheduled laws is decentralized and efficient. Each station’s jurisdiction is officially approved by the Government and notified, ensuring there’s no overlap or confusion about which station covers which area.\n\n• Fines and Penalties\n• Q: Will I get a chance to comply before being fined or punished?\n\nA: Yes. In most cases, PERA gives you an opportunity to comply voluntarily before imposing a fine or stronger action. Typically, an official notice or order will be served instructing you to fix the violation (for example, remove an encroachment or stop a public nuisance) within a specified time. For urgent issues that pose immediate harm, an officer may issue an Emergency Prohibition Order (EPO) on the spot, but even then you are given a short timeframe to obey or appeal the order. If you address the problem within the given time, or if you successfully challenge the notice through a Hearing Officer, you can avoid fines or further punishment. Enforcement fines or actions are usually applied only if you fail to take the corrective action as directed in the notice or order.\n\n• Q: What happens if I ignore a PERA notice or refuse to pay a fine?\n\nA: Ignoring PERA’s notices or orders will escalate the enforcement process. After the initial deadline passes without compliance, PERA officers are empowered to take direct action. They can forcibly remove or remedy the violation (e.g. clear an encroachment or abate a nuisance) using reasonable force, and you’ll be liable for any resulting enforcement costs. They can also impose additional fines as provided under the Act and even confiscate equipment or seal premises associated with the offence. If you continue to defy orders (for example, not paying fines or obstructing officers), PERA may register a case (FIR) with the police for further legal action.\n\n• Offences and Violations under PERA",

In practical terms, it functions somewhat like a police station but for PERA enforcement officers – it’s the base from which Enforcement Officers, SDEOs, Sergeants and other staff carry out operations in that area. Complaints are often lodged at the Enforcement Station; enforcement teams deploy from there to conduct inspections, raids, and other activities. Each Enforcement Station is headed by a Sub-Divisional Enforcement Officer (SDEO), who supervises the Enforcement Officers and sergeants in that station’s jurisdiction. The station maintains registers of inspections, seizures, etc., and coordinates with the District Enforcement and Regulatory Board (DERB) for that district. For the public, the Enforcement Station is the most accessible face of PERA. It’s where you might go to submit a complaint or respond to a notice. PERA plans to have multiple Enforcement Stations across Punjab, so that enforcement of scheduled laws is decentralized and efficient. Each station’s jurisdiction is officially approved by the Government and notified, ensuring there’s no overlap or confusion about which station covers which area.\n\n• Fines and Penalties\n• Q: Will I get a chance to comply before being fined or punished?\n\nA: Yes.

If you fail to do so, PERA will execute the order: officers will carry out necessary actions (removal, seizure, etc.), and you’ll face fines or other penalties as specified. Essentially, the Absolute Order is the final binding directive after due process (your hearing), and ignoring it has serious consequences.\n\n• Q: Do I have a right to be heard or contest a PERA action?\n\nA: Yes. PERA’s enforcement system includes provisions for due process. If you’re on the receiving end of an enforcement action (like an EPO or a notice of violation), you generally have the right to file a representation before a Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer is an independent official who will hear your side of the story. During the hearing, you can present evidence or explain your position. The Hearing Officer can then decide to uphold, cancel, or modify the enforcement order (and issue an Absolute Order accordingly). Furthermore, if you disagree with the Hearing Officer’s decision, the law allows you to appeal to higher authorities (first to the divisional Commissioner, and even to a court in second appeal) for redress. In short, while PERA officers can act swiftly to stop violations, the system ensures that citizens have an opportunity to be heard and to appeal decisions – you won’t be punished without a chance to defend yourself.\n\n• Police Involvement and Legal Action\n• Q: Can I be arrested for violating PERA? Will there be a criminal case (FIR)?\n\nA: Yes, serious violations can lead to arrest and criminal prosecution, though this usually happens in more extreme cases or repeat offenses. The PERA Act explicitly states that all offences under the Act are cognizable and non-bailable, meaning the police can arrest offenders without a warrant and bail is not a right. PERA’s SubDivisional Enforcement Officer (SDEO) is empowered to register an FIR (First Information Report) with the police for offences under the Act. In practice, PERA will involve the police if: you continue to defy orders or repeat a violation, if you assault or obstruct an officer, or in any situation where a simple fine or removal action isn’t sufficient to stop the offence.\n\n• Q: What will happen after FIR?\n• For most first-time or minor violations, PERA tries to handle the matter with its own\n\nnotices, fines, and hearings. But if those measures fail or the offence is of a criminal nature, it escalates to an FIR – at that point, you may be arrested and tried in court (offences under PERA are tried by magistrates). In summary, PERA can and will refer cases to the police when needed. It’s always better to comply with PERA’s directives early on, rather than face an FIR and criminal charges for noncompliance.",

                "text": "• Q: What types of violations are punishable under PERA?\n\nA: PERA covers a range of public offences. Key examples include:\n\n• Public Nuisance: Any illegal act or omission that causes common injury, danger or\n\nannoyance to the public is considered a public nuisance. This can include activities causing environmental hazards, health risks, excessive noise, or blocking public ways. Such nuisances are punishable under PERA – Enforcement Officers can issue orders to stop the nuisance and have it removed.\n\n• Encroachment on Public Property: Making an encroachment (moveable or\n\nimmoveable) on state/public land is strictly prohibited by law. This means you cannot unlawfully occupy or build on government property (for example, setting up an illegal structure on a road or park). PERA authorities can order the removal of encroachments; if you don’t comply in time, they will remove it and recover costs and fines from the encroacher.\n\n• Violating Official Orders (EPO/Absolute Order): If PERA issues an Emergency\n\nProhibition Order or a subsequent Absolute Order (after a hearing) and you refuse to comply, that refusal itself is a punishable offence. Non-compliance with these orders can result in PERA taking action to enforce the order (as described above) and imposing fines. Repeated or willful defiance can even lead to your arrest or an FIR for disobeying the law.\n\n• Obstructing Enforcement Officers: It is illegal to hinder or obstruct a PERA officer\n\nfrom performing their duties. If someone tries to interfere with an enforcement operation or attacks/threatens an officer, it is treated very seriously. Creating any obstruction for an Enforcement Officer can trigger immediate actions like arrest on the spot. Such conduct may also be prosecuted under relevant laws (since obstructing public servants is an offence). In summary, you must not resist or impede PERA officials – cooperation is in your best interest.\n\n• Other Offences: PERA also penalizes certain other acts, such as false\n\ncomplaints/whistle-blower misuse (knowingly giving false information or false whistle-blower reports) and misuse of authority by PERA employees, with fines specified for these in the law. While these may not directly concern most of the general public, they ensure accountability on all sides (for example, a person making a frivolous complaint to harass someone can be fined up to Rs. 100,000).\n\n• Enforcement Process (Notices, Hearings)\n• Q: What is an “Absolute Order” under PERA?\n\nA: An Absolute Order is essentially the follow-up, final order issued by a Hearing Officer after reviewing an EPO. If a person appeals an EPO, the Hearing Officer conducts a hearing and then can convert the temporary EPO into a more formal Absolute Order (or cancel/modify it). The Absolute Order will detail the nuisance or violation, confirm what must be done to fix it, set a final deadline, and mention any",

Compliance with PERA’s notices and orders early on can prevent such outcomes and keep the matter out of criminal courts.\n\n• Q: How can I report a violation or nuisance to PERA?\n\nA: If you’re a member of the public wanting to report an issue (like an illegal encroachment in your area or a public nuisance affecting your community), you can file a complaint to PERA. The law allows any aggrieved person or even a concerned bystander to report a public nuisance or encroachment to the Enforcement Officer or relevant PERA office. You may contact your local Enforcement Station (PERA office at the sub-division level) or use any official complaint channels PERA provides (such as a hotline or online portal, if available). When you report, give as many details as possible (location, nature of the problem, people involved, etc.). PERA will then investigate, whereby, PERA official will likely inspect the site, and if the issue falls under PERA’s mandate, they will take action (issuing notices or orders to the offender as described earlier). Reporting is encouraged because it helps the authority identify and address violations that affect the public. There are also whistle-blower protections in the Act – if you report in good faith, your identity can be kept confidential to protect you. Just ensure that the complaint is genuine; knowingly filing a false complaint is itself punishable.\n\n• Q: What are the consequences for a PERA officer if they misuse their authority?\n\nA: PERA not only enforces rules on the public, but also holds its own officers accountable under the law. If a PERA officer misuses power or acts corruptly, there are provisions to address this. Members of the public can file a grievance or complaint to the Grievance Redressal Commissioner (or the District Board) if they believe an officer has abused their authority. Internally, PERA Act Section 47 makes “misuse of authority by an employee” an offence that can be met with fines (up to Rs. 100,000). In serious cases, the officer could also face departmental disciplinary action or even criminal charges (if laws are broken). PERA officers must act within the law as the system has checks to prevent abuse. This helps ensure that enforcement actions are fair and not personal or arbitrary.
