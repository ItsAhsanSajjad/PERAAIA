This is to ensure that information provided by candidates is accurate and that individuals have a record befitting public service roles.

Any discrepancy (such as a fake degree or an unverifiable credential) is taken very seriously – it can lead to immediate withdrawal of the job offer or termination if discovered after joining, as it constitutes misconduct (submission of false documents). • Employment History and Reference Check: HR may verify past employment details provided by the candidate (for experienced hires). Typically, the last employer or two are contacted to confirm the duration of employment and the nature of the person’s exit. In many cases, candidates provide reference letters or contact information of supervisors. PERA may reach out via phone or official email to inquire about the candidate’s work ethic, conduct, and reason for leaving. This helps ensure we are not hiring someone with a history of serious misconduct elsewhere. • Character and Criminal Record Verification: A police verification or character certificate may also be required. The candidate may be asked to provide a Police Character Certificate from their local police station to check if the individual has any criminal record.

This includes performance evaluations, any pending disciplinary proceedings, and general conduct. Deputation is usually only accepted for officers who have a clean service record. PERA’s stance is that the integrity of personnel is non-negotiable. While we trust employees, we also verify. This ensures we maintain a workforce that the public and stakeholders can trust, which is critical in an enforcement and regulatory context. 2.4 Probation Period All initial appointments in PERA – whether of regular or contractual employees – are subject to a Probation Period. The probationary period allows the organization to evaluate a new hire’s performance, conduct, and overall fit for the job, and likewise gives the employee time to understand the role and expectations. The policy for probation is as follows: • Duration of Probation: A person appointed to a regular/permanent position typically undergoes a probation of minimum one (1) year from the date of joining, or as decided by Director General. If the employee’s performance is not satisfactory within this period, the probation may be extended once. For contractual employees, the probation period is usually shorter – commonly three (3) months or six (6) months, as specified in the contract agreement. The exact period for contract staff will be stated in their contract letter. • Probation Terms: During probation, the employee’s work performance, conduct, punctuality, and general suitability are observed and assessed by their immediate supervisor and concerned Director. Clear objectives or key performance indicators (KPIs) should be communicated to the probationer early on (as part of onboarding). Regular feedback should be given to help the probationer improve. Being on probation does not mean the employee is not fully subject to all rules – all policies of PERA apply to probationers as well. However, a probationer does not enjoy the same job security as a confirmed (permanent) employee, making it easier to discharge them if needed. • Confirmation Process: Shortly before the end of the probation period, the HR Department will remind the concerned supervisor to submit a Probation Evaluation Report.

This includes performance evaluations, any pending disciplinary proceedings, and general conduct. Deputation is usually only accepted for officers who have a clean service record. PERA’s stance is that the integrity of personnel is non-negotiable. While we trust employees, we also verify. This ensures we maintain a workforce that the public and stakeholders can trust, which is critical in an enforcement and regulatory context. 2.4 Probation Period All initial appointments in PERA – whether of regular or contractual employees – are subject to a Probation Period. The probationary period allows the organization to evaluate a new hire’s performance, conduct, and overall fit for the job, and likewise gives the employee time to understand the role and expectations. The policy for probation is as follows: • Duration of Probation: A person appointed to a regular/permanent position typically undergoes a probation of minimum one (1) year from the date of joining, or as decided by Director General. If the employee’s performance is not satisfactory within this period, the probation may be extended once. For contractual employees, the probation period is usually shorter – commonly three (3) months or six (6) months, as specified in the contract agreement. The exact period for contract staff will be stated in their contract letter. • Probation Terms: During probation, the employee’s work performance, conduct, punctuality, and general suitability are observed and assessed by their immediate supervisor and concerned Director. Clear objectives or key performance indicators (KPIs) should be communicated to the probationer early on (as part of onboarding). Regular feedback should be given to help the probationer improve. Being on probation does not mean the employee is not fully subject to all rules – all policies of PERA apply to probationers as well. However, a probationer does not enjoy the same job security as a confirmed (permanent) employee, making it easier to discharge them if needed. • Confirmation Process: Shortly before the end of the probation period, the HR Department will remind the concerned supervisor to submit a Probation Evaluation Report. This report will outline the employee’s performance, strengths, weaknesses, and a recommendation whether to confirm, extend probation, or terminate the employment. The evaluation"}

For regular employees, this means they attain permanent status; for contract employees, it simply means they have successfully passed the initial trial and continue for the rest of contract term. • Extension of Probation: If the employee’s performance has not been fully up to the mark, but the organization sees potential in the individual, an extension of the probation period may be granted for a specified term by the Director General. The extension decision must be communicated via a written order before the initial probation expires. It should outline the areas where improvement is needed and set targets for the extended period. If at the end of extended period, the performance still fails to meet requirements, the employee’s service may be dispensed with (not confirmed). • Termination During Probation: PERA reserves the right to terminate the employment of a probationary employee without the lengthy procedures required for confirmed staff. Termination during probation can be due to unsatisfactory performance, misconduct, or if the person is found unsuitable for the role. However, this step is taken after giving feedback and chances to improve, except in cases of serious misconduct which may warrant immediate removal. • Rights of Probationers: A probationary employee is not entitled to appeal a termination in the same way a permanent employee might, since by law their appointment was not confirmed.

All employees must mark their attendance daily, both at the time of arrival and departure. If an employee is assigned off-site duties or is on approved travel, they should notify their supervisor and HR so that attendance can be recorded appropriately. • Punctuality: Employees are expected to be present at their workstations and ready to work by the official start time. Habitual lateness is not acceptable. Persistent tardiness or leaving early without authorization will be noted and could lead to deductions in leave or pay, and disciplinary action if it continues despite warnings. • Absence and Leave Approval: Any planned absence from work during scheduled hours must be covered by an appropriate leave approval (see Chapter IV on Leave). If an employee is unexpectedly unable to attend (e.g., sudden illness or emergency), they must notify their supervisor or the HR office within the same working day, preferably at the start of the day by phone or email. Unauthorized absence (not informing or not having leave sanctioned) is treated seriously as it disrupts work and indicates negligence. • Attendance Monitoring: The Admin Wing will monitor attendance records on a periodic basis (weekly or monthly) to identify issues like chronic lateness or absenteeism.

Continued attendance issues after warnings can lead to formal disciplinary action.

Its\n\ncore mandate is to remove encroachments, resolve land-grabbing issues,\n\nensure price control, prevent hoarding, and fix public nuisances across the\n\nprovince.\n\n• What enforcement powers do PERA officers have?\n\nPERA’s enforcement officers have extensive powers granted by the Act. They can\n\nenter and inspect public places and (with a magistrate’s warrant) private premises\n\nto check for violation. They are empowered to issue notices or summons to\n\nviolators under the Act and Scheduled laws. They may seize goods or property used\n\nin an offence and seal premises that are violating regulations. PERA officers can\n\nalso impose fines (within prescribed limits) and even arrest offenders, using\n\nreasonable force if necessary, for obstruction or serious violations.\n\nPublic Complaints & Hearings\n\n• How can I file a complaint with PERA?\n\nAnyone from the public can file a complaint to PERA if they observe a violation of\n\nlaw (such as an encroachment or public nuisance). PERA has a Public Complaint\n\nIntake Form for this purpose. You would need to provide details like the location\n\nand nature of the issue, a description of the incident, and any evidence\n\n(photos/videos) if available.

The Hearing\n\nOfficer will examine the details and may initially call the complainant for any\n\nclarifications. If the complaint has merit, the Hearing Officer will issue an order for\n\ninquiry typically directing a PERA Officer (through the SDEO) to inspect the site of\n\nthe problem, gather facts, and take appropriate initial action.

The PERA Act explicitly encourages whistleblower disclosures. A “Whistle-\n\nblower” is defined in the law as any person who, in public interest, discloses a\n\nsuspected violation or offence under the Act. This means anyone (including a\n\ncitizen or a PERA employee) can confidentially report a violation of the law to\n\nPERA. The Act provides a formal mechanism for such whistle-blower disclosures –\n\nthey can be made in writing or electronic form to the Authority, a Board, a Hearing\n\nOfficer or an enforcement officer.

This confidentiality applies even after the case is concluded.\n\nAny unauthorized disclosure of a whistleblower’s identity is an offence as it can\n\nresult in a fine or penalty for the person who breaches that confidentiality.\n\nFurthermore, PERA (or the Hearing Officer on its behalf) can take special measures\n\nto protect whistleblowers who might be at risk due to their disclosure. This could\n\ninclude ensuring anonymity in proceedings or providing other protections as\n\nneeded.

Minor penalties include: a censure (official\n\nreprimand); confinement to quarters for ranks like Sergeants (up to 15 days);\n\nwithholding of increments (salary raises) for a specified period (up to 5 years); a\n\nfine (up to one month’s basic pay); reduction to a lower stage in the pay scale\n\n(demotion by a few pay steps, up to 5 stages); and withholding of promotion for a\n\nperiod (up to 5 years).

Contractual employees, on the other hand, are hired for\n\nspecific periods (e.g.3-year contract). PERA has issued separate regulations to\n\ngovern the terms of contractual staff – the PERA (Appointment and Conditions of\n\nService for Contractual Employees) Regulations, 2025. The fundamental difference\n\nis in terms of job security and benefits: Regular employees enjoy pension or\n\nretirement benefits and have a career path in the organization, whereas contractual\n\nemployees are not pensionable and their contract can simply expire at the end of\n\nterm (or be renewed). Contractual staff may also have different leave entitlements\n\nand slightly different disciplinary procedures (often a simpler process for\n\ntermination if needed, compared to permanent employees). However, in day-to-day\n\nroles, contractual employees work alongside regular employees and are expected\n\nto follow the same operational rules and code of conduct. PERA often uses\n\ncontractual appointments for certain technical roles or to staff new units quickly.\n\nThat said, all PERA employees, whether regular or contract, are considered\n\n“employees of the Authority” and are bound by PERA’s Act and rules. They are also\n\nall deemed public servants under the law[75], meaning they must uphold similar\n\nstandards of integrity.\n\n• Is there a probation period for new PERA employees?\n\nYes, all newly appointed PERA employees go through a probation period. For\n\nregular (permanent) appointments, the probation is typically one year from the date\n\nof joining (as per standard government practice, it may be extendable once if\n\nneeded). For contractual employees, the probation period is usually shorter –\n\ncommonly three months (and in some cases up to six months) depending on the\n\ncontract terms. The purpose of probation is to allow PERA to evaluate a new hire’s\n\nperformance, conduct, and suitability for the role, and likewise for the employee to\n\nunderstand the job expectations. During probation, the employee’s immediate\n\nsupervisor closely monitors their work and provides feedback. If the employee’s\n\nperformance is satisfactory by the end of probation, their appointment is\n\nconfirmed (in case of regular staff). If performance is weak but shows potential, the\n\nprobation can be extended once to give additional time for improvement.

This can include activities\n\ncausing environmental hazards, health risks, excessive noise, or blocking public\n\nways. Such nuisances are punishable under PERA – Enforcement Officers can issue\n\norders to stop the nuisance and have it removed.\n\n• Encroachment on Public Property: Making an encroachment (moveable or\n\nimmoveable) on state/public land is strictly prohibited by law. This means you\n\ncannot unlawfully occupy or build on government property (for example, setting up\n\nan illegal structure on a road or park). PERA authorities can order the removal of\n\nencroachments; if you don’t comply in time, they will remove it and recover costs\n\nand fines from the encroacher.\n\n• Violating Official Orders (EPO/Absolute Order): If PERA issues an Emergency\n\nProhibition Order or a subsequent Absolute Order (after a hearing) and you refuse\n\nto comply, that refusal itself is a punishable offence. Non-compliance with these\n\norders can result in PERA taking action to enforce the order (as described above)\n\nand imposing fines. Repeated or willful defiance can even lead to your arrest or an\n\nFIR for disobeying the law.\n\n• Obstructing Enforcement Officers: It is illegal to hinder or obstruct a PERA officer\n\nfrom performing their duties. If someone tries to interfere with an enforcement\n\noperation or attacks/threatens an officer, it is treated very seriously. Creating any\n\nobstruction for an Enforcement Officer can trigger immediate actions like arrest\n\non the spot. Such conduct may also be prosecuted under relevant laws (since\n\nobstructing public servants is an offence). In summary, you must not resist or\n\nimpede PERA officials – cooperation is in your best interest.\n\n• Other Offences: PERA also penalizes certain other acts, such as false\n\ncomplaints/whistle-blower misuse (knowingly giving false information or false\n\nwhistle-blower reports) and misuse of authority by PERA employees, with fines\n\nspecified for these in the law. While these may not directly concern most of the\n\ngeneral public, they ensure accountability on all sides (for example, a person\n\nmaking a frivolous complaint to harass someone can be fined up to Rs. 100,000).\n\n• Enforcement Process (Notices, Hearings)\n\n• Q: What is an “Absolute Order” under PERA?\n\nA: An Absolute Order is essentially the follow-up, final order issued by a Hearing\n\nOfficer after reviewing an EPO. If a person appeals an EPO, the Hearing Officer\n\nconducts a hearing and then can convert the temporary EPO into a more formal\n\nAbsolute Order (or cancel/modify it).

Some specific scenarios include:\n\n• Obstruction or Violence: If someone attacks, threatens, or seriously obstructs a\n\nPERA enforcement team, an FIR will likely be lodged immediately for obstructing\n\nofficial duties.
