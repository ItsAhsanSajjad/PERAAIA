The goal is to attract qualified candidates and ensure fairness and equal opportunity in hiring. The Admin Wing, in coordination with relevant Directors, will determine staffing needs and obtain approval for recruitment from the Competent Authority. Each position will have a clear job description outlining duties, required qualifications, experience, and competencies. The whole process of recruitment will be strictly followed as per relevant service regulations. All records of the recruitment process (scores, applications, decisions) are kept on file for audit and in case of any appeal or review. No hiring shall be made on the basis of canvassing, personal favor, or pressure; any attempt to unduly influence the recruitment process by a candidate or insider is grounds for candidate’s disqualification and possible disciplinary action for the insider. Recruitment of relatives (nepotism) is also handled carefully: if a candidate is an immediate relative of a current PERA employee or Board member, this must be disclosed to avoid conflict of interest (and such an employee may recuse from the selection process). In summary, the selection process at PERA is designed to be fair, competitive, and based on merit. This ensures that the Authority brings in competent individuals of integrity, which is essential for an organization entrusted with enforcement and regulatory duties. 2.2 Candidate Onboarding Onboarding is the process of integrating a newly hired employee into PERA and equipping them with the information and tools needed to become effective and comfortable in their role. PERA’s onboarding process is thorough and formal, reflecting our structured environment. The following steps are involved once a candidate has accepted the offer of employment: • Documentation and Appointment Formalities: The selected candidate is required to submit necessary documents for HR records and verification. These typically include: academic degrees/certificates (in original for verification and photocopies to keep on file), experience letters from previous employers, national identity card (CNIC) copy, passport-size photographs, Police Character Certificate etc. Candidates must also submit a medical", "text_sha256": "04097750a80f468368d220098d15864bce6fbb7c505e7527ab6fa97740ca0640", "embedding_model": "text-embedding-3-small", "embed_model_version": 1, "embed_text_version": 4, "embed_text_sha256": "858d430d0df313f5bc7a574abb7e78f36d5c52f08a24637058a5e1ba9e119677", "search_text_version": 3, "search_text_sha256": "756fdc6cd9575d7c3b96947a4fc1f8ad9b9ace19a122f797fa0091d8f13a8518", "search_text": "DOC: Compiled Working Paper_2nd Meeting PERA 03-07-2025.pdf\nTYPE: pdf\nLOC: Page 441\nTAGS: pera, members, appeal, process, recruitment, qualification, experience, discipline\n\nChapter II: Recruitment 2.1 Selection Process PERA recruits employees through a transparent, merit-based selection process that aligns with organization’s specific needs.

This ensures that the Authority brings in competent individuals of integrity, which is essential for an organization entrusted with enforcement and regulatory duties. 2.2 Candidate Onboarding Onboarding is the process of integrating a newly hired employee into PERA and equipping them with the information and tools needed to become effective and comfortable in their role. PERA’s onboarding process is thorough and formal, reflecting our structured environment. The following steps are involved once a candidate has accepted the offer of employment: • Documentation and Appointment Formalities: The selected candidate is required to submit necessary documents for HR records and verification. These typically include: academic degrees/certificates (in original for verification and photocopies to keep on file), experience letters from previous employers, national identity card (CNIC) copy, passport-size photographs, Police Character Certificate etc. Candidates must also submit a medical"}

This is to ensure that information provided by candidates is accurate and that individuals have a record befitting public service roles.

Any discrepancy (such as a fake degree or an unverifiable credential) is taken very seriously – it can lead to immediate withdrawal of the job offer or termination if discovered after joining, as it constitutes misconduct (submission of false documents). • Employment History and Reference Check: HR may verify past employment details provided by the candidate (for experienced hires). Typically, the last employer or two are contacted to confirm the duration of employment and the nature of the person’s exit. In many cases, candidates provide reference letters or contact information of supervisors. PERA may reach out via phone or official email to inquire about the candidate’s work ethic, conduct, and reason for leaving.

The candidate may be asked to provide a Police Character Certificate from their local police station to check if the individual has any criminal record.

This ensures we maintain a workforce that the public and stakeholders can trust, which is critical in an enforcement and regulatory context. 2.4 Probation Period All initial appointments in PERA – whether of regular or contractual employees – are subject to a Probation Period. The probationary period allows the organization to evaluate a new hire’s performance, conduct, and overall fit for the job, and likewise gives the employee time to understand the role and expectations. The policy for probation is as follows: • Duration of Probation: A person appointed to a regular/permanent position typically undergoes a probation of minimum one (1) year from the date of joining, or as decided by Director General. If the employee’s performance is not satisfactory within this period, the probation may be extended once. For contractual employees, the probation period is usually shorter – commonly three (3) months or six (6) months, as specified in the contract agreement. The exact period for contract staff will be stated in their contract letter. • Probation Terms: During probation, the employee’s work performance, conduct, punctuality, and general suitability are observed and assessed by their immediate supervisor and concerned Director.

However, a probationer does not enjoy the same job security as a confirmed (permanent) employee, making it easier to discharge them if needed. • Confirmation Process: Shortly before the end of the probation period, the HR Department will remind the concerned supervisor to submit a Probation Evaluation Report.

Employees must protect PERA’s information assets: do not share passwords, do not copy official data onto personal devices or cloud services without permission, and do not disclose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. All emails sent from official accounts should be professional and related to work. • Office Premises and Furniture: Employees should care for their workspaces, meeting rooms, and common areas. Office furniture and fixtures should not be willfully damaged or reconfigured without approval. Switch off lights, Acs, and electrical equipment when leaving if you are the last person, to conserve energy and prevent hazards. • Intellectual Property and Documents: Reports, manuals, software, and other materials produced by employees as part of their job are the property of PERA. Removing original files or official documents from the office without authorization is prohibited. Any loss or theft of official documents must be reported. Employees must also refrain from using PERA’s name, logo, letterheads, or official stamps for non-official purposes. Misuse of letterhead or stamps (for example, to issue an unauthorised letter) is misconduct. In summary, PERA’s assets are public property intended to support its regulatory mission. All employees are stewards of these resources and shall protect and conserve them, and ensure they are used only for authorized activities. By doing so, we uphold public trust and maintain operational efficiency. 4.7 Work Hours, Attendance and Punctuality PERA has defined standard working hours and expects all employees to follow them diligently. Maintaining regular attendance and punctuality is crucial for the smooth functioning of the"}

The guidelines for office hours and attendance are as follows: • Attendance Recording: PERA may use an electronic attendance system (e.g., biometric scanners or an attendance software) to record when employees clock in and out each day. All employees must mark their attendance daily, both at the time of arrival and departure. If an employee is assigned off-site duties or is on approved travel, they should notify their supervisor and HR so that attendance can be recorded appropriately. • Punctuality: Employees are expected to be present at their workstations and ready to work by the official start time. Habitual lateness is not acceptable. Persistent tardiness or leaving early without authorization will be noted and could lead to deductions in leave or pay, and disciplinary action if it continues despite warnings. • Absence and Leave Approval: Any planned absence from work during scheduled hours must be covered by an appropriate leave approval (see Chapter IV on Leave). If an employee is unexpectedly unable to attend (e.g., sudden illness or emergency), they must notify their supervisor or the HR office within the same working day, preferably at the start of the day by phone or email. Unauthorized absence (not informing or not having leave sanctioned) is treated seriously as it disrupts work and indicates negligence. • Attendance Monitoring: The Admin Wing will monitor attendance records on a periodic basis (weekly or monthly) to identify issues like chronic lateness or absenteeism. In case of unsatisfactory attendance, HR will issue a verbal or written counselling to the employee and may copy the relevant Director. Continued attendance issues after warnings can lead to formal disciplinary action.

These are discretionary rewards, not guaranteed entitlements. Employees will be awarded honorarium as per Punjab Enforcement & Regulatory Authority (Performance Appraisal) Regulations, 2025. 6.5 Payroll Deductions Certain amounts may be deducted from an employee’s salary either due to legal requirements, employee enrollments in benefit programs, or specific situations like penalties or adjustments. PERA’s payroll system will ensure all deductions are transparent and appropriately authorized. The typical deductions that may appear on an employee’s payslip include: • Income Tax: Salaries are subject to withholding of income tax under the law. PERA, as an employer, will deduct income tax at source from monthly salaries in accordance with prevailing tax rates/slabs notified by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). The tax deduction is computed on the basis of the employee’s projected annual taxable income (salary plus any honoraria etc.) considering applicable exemptions or relief (like taxable income threshold). • Provident Fund / Benevolent Fund: For regular and contractual employees, monthly deductions shall be made from their salary as determined by the Authority. These contributions will be credited to the employee’s provident fund or relevant account and payable upon retirement/separation as per applicable rules.

These are discretionary rewards, not guaranteed entitlements. Employees will be awarded honorarium as per Punjab Enforcement & Regulatory Authority (Performance Appraisal) Regulations, 2025. 6.5 Payroll Deductions Certain amounts may be deducted from an employee’s salary either due to legal requirements, employee enrollments in benefit programs, or specific situations like penalties or adjustments. PERA’s payroll system will ensure all deductions are transparent and appropriately authorized. The typical deductions that may appear on an employee’s payslip include: • Income Tax: Salaries are subject to withholding of income tax under the law. PERA, as an employer, will deduct income tax at source from monthly salaries in accordance with prevailing tax rates/slabs notified by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). The tax deduction is computed on the basis of the employee’s projected annual taxable income (salary plus any honoraria etc.) considering applicable exemptions or relief (like taxable income threshold). • Provident Fund / Benevolent Fund: For regular and contractual employees, monthly deductions shall be made from their salary as determined by the Authority. These contributions will be credited to the employee’s provident fund or relevant account and payable upon retirement/separation as per applicable rules. The Directorate General retains full discretion to modify deduction rates, contribution structures, or eligibility criteria in accordance with organizational needs and regulatory frameworks. Voluntary additional contributions (if permitted) shall also be governed by the Authority’s prevailing policies. • Absent or Unpaid Leave Deductions: If an employee had any days of leave without pay or was absent without pay in a month, the proportional salary for those days will be deducted. Decision regarding deduction of salary will be taken by Director General at Directorate level and SDEO at Enforcement Station."}

The goal is to attract qualified candidates and ensure fairness and equal opportunity in hiring.

Each position will have a clear job description outlining duties, required qualifications, experience, and competencies. The whole process of recruitme nt will be strictly followed as per relevant service regulations. All records of the recruitment process (scores, applications, decisions) are kept on file for audit and in case of any appeal or review. No hiring shall be made on the basis of canvassing, personal favor, or pressure; any attempt to unduly influence the recruitment process by a candidate or insider is grounds for candidate’s disqualification and possible disciplinary action for the insider. Recruitment of relatives (nepotism) is also handled carefully: if a candidate is an immediate relative of a current PERA employee or Board member, this must be disclosed to avoid conflict of interest (and such an employee may recuse from the selection process). In summary, the selection process at PERA is designed to be fair, competitive, and based on merit. This ensures that the Authority brings in competent individuals of integrity, which is essential for an organization entrusted with enforcement and regulatory duties. 2.2 Candidate Onboarding Onboarding is the process of integrating a newly hired employee into PERA and equipping them with the information and tools needed to become effective and comfortable in their role. PERA’s onboarding process is thorough and formal, reflecting our structured environment. The following steps are involved once a candidate has accepted the offer of employment:\n\n• Documentation and Appointment Formalities: The selected candidate is required to\nsubmit necessary documents for HR records and verification.

Recruitment of relatives (nepotism) is also handled carefully: if a candidate is an immediate relative of a current PERA employee or Board member, this must be disclosed to avoid conflict of interest (and such an employee may recuse from the selection process). In summary, the selection process at PERA is designed to be fair, competitive, and based on merit. This ensures that the Authority brings in competent individuals of integrity, which is essential for an organization entrusted with enforcement and regulatory duties. 2.2 Candidate Onboarding Onboarding is the process of integrating a newly hired employee into PERA and equipping them with the information and tools needed to become effective and comfortable in their role. PERA’s onboarding process is thorough and formal, reflecting our structured environment. The following steps are involved once a candidate has accepted the offer of employment:\n\n• Documentation and Appointment Formalities: The selected candidate is required to\nsubmit necessary documents for HR records and verification. These typically include:\nacademic degrees/certificates (in original for verification and photocopies to keep on file), experience letters from previous employers, national identity card (CNIC) copy, passport- size photographs, Police Character Certificate etc. Candidates must also submit a medical"}

Switch off lights, A cs, and electrical equipment when leaving if you are the last person, to conserve energy and prevent hazards.\n\n• Intellectual Property and Documents: Reports, manuals, software, and other materials\nproduced by employees as part of their job are the property of PERA. Removing original files or official documents from the office without authorization is prohibited. Any loss or theft of official documents must be reported. Employees must also refrain from using PERA’s name, logo, letterheads, or official stamps for non -official purposes. Misuse of letterhead or stamps (for example, to issue an unauthorised letter) is misconduct. In summary, PERA’s assets are public property intended to support its regulatory mission. All employees are stewards of these resources and shall protect and conserve them, and ensure they are used only for authorized activities. By doing so, we uphold public trust and maintain operational efficiency. 4.7 Work Hours, Attendance and Punctuality PERA has defined standard working hours and expects all employees to follow them diligently.

If an employee is unexpectedly unable to attend (e.g., sudden illness or emergency), they must notify their supervisor or the HR office within the same working day, preferably at the start of the day by phone or email.

PERA, as\nan employer, will deduct income tax at source from monthly salaries in accordance with prevailing tax rates/slabs notified by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). The tax deduction is computed on the basis of the employee’s projected annual taxable income (salary plus any honoraria etc.) considering applicable exemptions or relief (like taxable income threshold).\n\n• Provident Fund / Benevolent Fund : For regular and contractual employees , monthly\ndeductions shall be made from their salary as determined by the Authority. These contributions will be credited to the employee’s provident fund or relevant account and payable upon retirement/separation as per applicable rules. The Directorate General retains full discretion to modify deduction rates, contribution structures, or eligibility criteria in accordance with organizational needs and regulatory frameworks. Voluntary additional contributions (if permitted) shall also be governed by the Authorit y’s prevailing policies.\n\n• Absent or Unpaid Leave Deductions: If an employee had any days of leave without pay\nor was absent without pay in a month, the proportional salary for those days will be deducted. Decision regarding deduction of salary will be taken by Director General at Directorate level and SDEO at Enforcement Station."}

Its core mandate is to remove encroachments, resolve land-grabbing issues, ensure price control, prevent hoarding, and fix public nuisances across the province.\n\n• What enforcement powers do PERA officers have?\nPERA’s enforcement officers have extensive powers granted by the Act. They can enter and inspect public places and (with a magistrate’s warrant) private premises to check for violation. They are empowered to issue notices or summons to violators under the Act and Scheduled laws. They may seize goods or property used in an offence and seal premises that are violating regulations. PERA officers can also impose fines (within prescribed limits) and even arrest offenders, using reasonable force if necessary, for obstruction or serious violations. Public Complaints & Hearings\n\n• How can I file a complaint with PERA?\nAnyone from the public can file a complaint to PERA if they observe a violation of law (such as an encroachment or public nuisance). PERA has a Public Complaint Intake Form for this purpose. You would need to provide details like the location and nature of the issue, a description of the incident, and any evidence (photos/videos) if available. The complaint can be submitted to the nearest PERA Enforcement Station or through the online channels provided by PERA. The form allows for both identified and anonymous complaints and captures all essential information to initiate an inquiry (e.g., date, location, description of violation, etc.). Once submitted, PERA will log the complaint and assign an officer to look into the matter.\n\n• What happens after I file a complaint?\nAfter a complaint is filed, it is reviewed by a PERA Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer will examine the details and may initially call the complainant for any clarifications. If the complaint has merit, the Hearing Officer will issue an order for inquiry typically directing a PERA Officer (through the SDEO) to inspect the site of the problem, gather facts, and take appropriate initial action. If the complaint appears frivolous or baseless, the Hearing Officer can dismiss the complaint through a written order. PERA’s rules require that public nuisance or encroachment complaints be decided quickly, usually within 15 days of filing.\n\n• What is a Hearing Officer and what do they do?\nA Hearing Officer is an official appointed by PERA to conduct quasi-judicial proceedings under the Act.

Hearing Officers have the power to pass orders to redress a grievance or to reject complaints that are unfounded. Whistleblower & Identity Protection\n\n• Does PERA have a whistleblower program?\nYes. The PERA Act explicitly encourages whistleblower disclosures. A “Whistle- blower” is defined in the law as any person who, in public interest, discloses a suspected violation or offence under the Act. This means anyone (including a citizen or a PERA employee) can confidentially report a violation of the law to PERA. The Act provides a formal mechanism for such whistle-blower disclosures – they can be made in writing or electronic form to the Authority, a Board, a Hearing Officer or an enforcement officer. PERA values these disclosures as a way to uncover violations that might otherwise go unnoticed. In fact, if a whistleblower’s information leads to a successful enforcement action, PERA may reward the whistleblower with a monetary reward from its fund and a certificate of appreciation.\n\n• Will my identity be protected if I report an issue as a whistleblower?\nAbsolutely. Protecting the whistleblower’s identity is a core principle in PERA’s law. The Act explicitly states that the identity of a whistleblower shall not be disclosed without their consent. This confidentiality applies even after the case is concluded. Any unauthorized disclosure of a whistleblower’s identity is an offence as it can result in a fine or penalty for the person who breaches that confidentiality. Furthermore, PERA (or the Hearing Officer on its behalf) can take special measures to protect whistleblowers who might be at risk due to their disclosure. This could include ensuring anonymity in proceedings or providing other protections as needed. In summary, if you come forward with information as a whistleblower, PERA will guard your identity and you will be shielded by law against retaliation or exposure.\n\n• Are whistleblowers rewarded or penalized for their disclosures?\nPERA’s policy is to reward genuine whistleblowers and discourage false reports. If your whistleblower disclosure leads to uncovering a real violation or prevents a harm, PERA may grant you a reward (such as a cash reward from a designated fund) and even a certificate of appreciation. This is to recognize public-spirited individuals who help PERA enforce the law. On the other hand, if someone deliberately makes a false, frivolous or vexatious report under the guise of whistleblowing, the law provides for punishment: such a person, after due inquiry, can face up to one year imprisonment or a fine up to Rs. 100,000 (or both).

It must be obeyed immediately.\n\n• Q: What happens if I ignore an EPO?\nA: Non-compliance can lead to heavier fines, forced removal, sealing, or FIR registration.\n• Who can issue an EPO, and under what authority?\nAn EPO is issued by a PERA Enforcement Officer (on the ground) but it must be approved by a senior officer, specifically the Sub Divisional Enforcement Officer (SDEO) of the relevant tehsil. The legal authority for EPO comes from Section 38 of the PERA Act, 2024 which empowers PERA to prohibit any activity causing immediate threat, and the detailed procedure is laid out in the PERA Rules (Operations & Procedures) 2025. In practice, when an Enforcement Officer encounters an emergency situation, they document the observations (time, place, nature of threat) and obtain the SDEO’s consent (which can even be given verbally in true emergencies) to issue the order. The EPO is then formally served to the concerned parties (it can be delivered in person, posted on-site, published in newspapers or uploaded digitally, as needed for wide notice). The order cites the law (Section 38 of the Act and relevant rules) and clearly describes what is forbidden effective immediately. In summary, PERA Enforcement Officers issue EPOs under the law’s emergency powers, with oversight from their SDEO, to quickly neutralize urgent dangers.\n\n• Can an EPO be challenged or lifted?\nYes, there is a mechanism to challenge an EPO. If you are affected by an Emergency Prohibition Order and believe it’s unjustified or no longer necessary, you can file a representation (appeal) to a PERA Hearing Officer just as you would for other enforcement actions. In the appeal (using the standard representation form), you should attach a copy of the EPO and any evidence or arguments why the order should be modified or set aside. The Hearing Officer will then schedule a prompt hearing given the urgent nature of EPOs. It’s important to note that filing an appeal doesn’t automatically suspend the EPO – the order remains in effect until and unless the Hearing Officer or a competent authority decides to lift it.

The main triggers include: inefficiency (if an employee is found unable or unwilling to perform their duties effectively); misconduct (any improper behavior or violation of service discipline); corruption (for example, if the employee is living beyond known means or has unexplained wealth, or any act of accepting bribes, etc., similar to definitions under the Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act); and subversive activities or security breaches (if an employee is engaged in activities prejudicial to national security or discloses official secrets unlawfully).\n\n• What are the penalties for misconduct by a PERA employee?\nPERA’s Efficiency & Discipline Regulations list a range of penalties that can be imposed on employees found guilty of misconduct or other offences, categorized as minor and major penalties. Minor penalties include: a censure (official reprimand); confinement to quarters for ranks like Sergeants (up to 15 days); withholding of increments (salary raises) for a specified period (up to 5 years); a fine (up to one month’s basic pay); reduction to a lower stage in the pay scale (demotion by a few pay steps, up to 5 stages); and withholding of promotion for a period (up to 5 years). These minor penalties are for less severe infractions. Major penalties are more severe and include: recovery of losses (deducting from the employee’s pay or pension the amount of any loss caused by their misconduct); reduction to a lower post/grade for up to 5 years (temporary demotion in rank); forfeiture of service (not counting a certain period of service toward benefits, up to 5 years); compulsory retirement from service; removal from service (which is termination but not disqualification for future employment); and dismissal from service (the strictest penalty, which usually disqualifies the person from future government employment).\n\n• How are disciplinary proceedings conducted for employees?\nDisciplinary proceedings in PERA follow a formal, step-by-step process to ensure fairness (much like general government servants’ rules). When an allegation arises, the competent authority (a senior official designated to deal with discipline) may first do a fact-finding or issue a show-cause notice. If a formal inquiry is needed, the employee (now “accused”) is given a charge sheet – a written statement of the charges and allegations, along with any evidence – and asked to submit a written defense within a specified time (usually 7 days). An Inquiry Officer or Inquiry Committee is appointed (they must be senior in rank to the accused) to conduct the inquiry.

Throughout this, the employee has the right to a defense and to be heard in person if they request. The goal of the procedure is to ensure that no one is punished without evidence and an opportunity to explain their side, as per PERA’s regulations and general principles of due process.\n\n• Can a PERA employee appeal a disciplinary decision?\nYes. PERA employees have the right to appeal against disciplinary penalties. The Efficiency & Discipline Regulations designate an Appellate Authority for each type of employee (often a higher official or committee, as listed in Schedule-I of the regulations). If an employee is aggrieved by the punishment ordered by the competent authority, they can file a departmental appeal to the Appellate Authority. The appeal must usually be submitted within a certain time frame (commonly 30 days from the order). The Appellate Authority will review the case, which may include re-examining the evidence or considering any new facts, and then pass an order – either upholding the original decision, modifying the penalty, or overturning it. Beyond the departmental appeal, PERA’s regulations also allow a revision in certain cases[69], which is another review (often by the highest authority or the Authority Board) if there is some glaring issue or illegality in the orders of the lower authorities. It’s worth noting that during appeal, the implementation of the penalty may be paused or it may continue – depending on the rules and the discretion of the appellate authority. Also, even after exhausting internal appeals, an employee could seek judicial remedy (e.g., in Punjab Service Tribunal) as per general service laws. But within PERA’s framework, yes, there is an internal appeals process to ensure no disciplinary action is final until a higher authority has had a chance to review it, if the employee so requests. Recruitment and Conditions of Service\n\n• How does PERA recruit its employees?\nPERA follows a merit-based recruitment process for hiring. When there are vacancies, these are typically advertised publicly (in newspapers or online) to invite applications. Candidates go through a selection procedure that can include written tests, interviews, and background checks. The selection is designed to be fair and transparent. A Selection Panel/Committee assesses the candidates against the required qualifications and competencies for the role. PERA places emphasis on hiring people with relevant skills and a good track record, often preferring candidates with understanding of the “Scheduled laws” and needed technical abilities (for enforcement roles, physical fitness and integrity are important as well).

All regular appointments are made under Section 11 of the Act (with government approval where required) and according to the PERA (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Regulations, 2025.\n\n• What is the difference between regular and contractual employees at PERA?\nPERA has both regular (permanent) employees and contractual employees. Regular employees are those appointed against permanent posts – they usually join on probation (typically for one year) and upon confirmation become permanent staff with ongoing tenure. Contractual employees, on the other hand, are hired for specific periods (e.g.3-year contract). PERA has issued separate regulations to govern the terms of contractual staff – the PERA (Appointment and Conditions of Service for Contractual Employees) Regulations, 2025. The fundamental difference is in terms of job security and benefits: Regular employees enjoy pension or retirement benefits and have a career path in the organization, whereas contractual employees are not pensionable and their contract can simply expire at the end of term (or be renewed). Contractual staff may also have different leave entitlements and slightly different disciplinary procedures (often a simpler process for termination if needed, compared to permanent employees). However, in day-to-day roles, contractual employees work alongside regular employees and are expected to follow the same operational rules and code of conduct. PERA often uses contractual appointments for certain technical roles or to staff new units quickly. That said, all PERA employees, whether regular or contract, are considered “employees of the Authority” and are bound by PERA’s Act and rules. They are also all deemed public servants under the law[75], meaning they must uphold similar standards of integrity.\n\n• Is there a probation period for new PERA employees?\nYes, all newly appointed PERA employees go through a probation period. For regular (permanent) appointments, the probation is typically one year from the date of joining (as per standard government practice, it may be extendable once if needed). For contractual employees, the probation period is usually shorter – commonly three months (and in some cases up to six months) depending on the contract terms. The purpose of probation is to allow PERA to evaluate a new hire’s performance, conduct, and suitability for the role, and likewise for the employee to understand the job expectations. During probation, the employee’s immediate supervisor closely monitors their work and provides feedback. If the employee’s performance is satisfactory by the end of probation, their appointment is confirmed (in case of regular staff). If performance is weak but shows potential, the probation can be extended once to give additional time for improvement. However, if the employee is found unsuitable or has serious issues, PERA can terminate the employment during or at the end of probation without the full process required for confirmed employees\n\n• What is an Enforcement Station?\nAn Enforcement Station is essentially a local field office or unit of PERA.

In practical terms, it functions somewhat like a police station but for PERA enforcement officers – it’s the base from which Enforcement Officers, SDEOs, Sergeants and other staff carry out operations in that area. Complaints are often lodged at the Enforcement Station; enforcement teams deploy from there to conduct inspections, raids, and other activities. Each Enforcement Station is headed by a Sub-Divisional Enforcement Officer (SDEO), who supervises the Enforcement Officers and sergeants in that station’s jurisdiction. The station maintains registers of inspections, seizures, etc., and coordinates with the District Enforcement and Regulatory Board (DERB) for that district. For the public, the Enforcement Station is the most accessible face of PERA. It’s where you might go to submit a complaint or respond to a notice. PERA plans to have multiple Enforcement Stations across Punjab, so that enforcement of scheduled laws is decentralized and efficient.

In most cases, PERA gives you an opportunity to comply voluntarily before imposing a fine or stronger action. Typically, an official notice or order will be served instructing you to fix the violation (for example, remove an encroachment or stop a public nuisance) within a specified time. For urgent issues that pose immediate harm, an officer may issue an Emergency Prohibition Order (EPO) on the spot, but even then you are given a short timeframe to obey or appeal the order.

Enforcement fines or actions are usually applied only if you fail to take the corrective action as directed in the notice or order.\n\n• Q: What happens if I ignore a PERA notice or refuse to pay a fine?\nA: Ignoring PERA’s notices or orders will escalate the enforcement process. After the initial deadline passes without compliance, PERA officers are empowered to take direct action. They can forcibly remove or remedy the violation (e.g. clear an encroachment or abate a nuisance) using reasonable force, and you’ll be liable for any resulting enforcement costs.

Key examples include:\n• Public Nuisance: Any illegal act or omission that causes common injury, danger or\nannoyance to the public is considered a public nuisance. This can include activities causing environmental hazards, health risks, excessive noise, or blocking public ways. Such nuisances are punishable under PERA – Enforcement Officers can issue orders to stop the nuisance and have it removed.\n\n• Encroachment on Public Property: Making an encroachment (moveable or\nimmoveable) on state/public land is strictly prohibited by law. This means you cannot unlawfully occupy or build on government property (for example, setting up an illegal structure on a road or park). PERA authorities can order the removal of encroachments; if you don’t comply in time, they will remove it and recover costs and fines from the encroacher.\n\n• Violating Official Orders (EPO/Absolute Order): If PERA issues an Emergency\nProhibition Order or a subsequent Absolute Order (after a hearing) and you refuse to comply, that refusal itself is a punishable offence. Non-compliance with these orders can result in PERA taking action to enforce the order (as described above) and imposing fines. Repeated or willful defiance can even lead to your arrest or an FIR for disobeying the law.\n\n• Obstructing Enforcement Officers: It is illegal to hinder or obstruct a PERA officer\nfrom performing their duties. If someone tries to interfere with an enforcement operation or attacks/threatens an officer, it is treated very seriously. Creating any obstruction for an Enforcement Officer can trigger immediate actions like arrest on the spot. Such conduct may also be prosecuted under relevant laws (since obstructing public servants is an offence). In summary, you must not resist or impede PERA officials – cooperation is in your best interest.\n\n• Other Offences: PERA also penalizes certain other acts, such as false\ncomplaints/whistle-blower misuse (knowingly giving false information or false whistle-blower reports) and misuse of authority by PERA employees, with fines specified for these in the law. While these may not directly concern most of the general public, they ensure accountability on all sides (for example, a person making a frivolous complaint to harass someone can be fined up to Rs. 100,000).\n\n• Enforcement Process (Notices, Hearings)\n• Q: What is an “Absolute Order” under PERA?\nA: An Absolute Order is essentially the follow-up, final order issued by a Hearing Officer after reviewing an EPO. If a person appeals an EPO, the Hearing Officer conducts a hearing and then can convert the temporary EPO into a more formal Absolute Order (or cancel/modify it). The Absolute Order will detail the nuisance or violation, confirm what must be done to fix it, set a final deadline, and mention any", "text_sha256": "2edd9aa355246ab6ef3aca90c17f2c65d734e3987a2bee67c86666d54f261a52", "embedding_model": "text-embedding-3-small", "embed_model_version": 1, "embed_text_version": 4, "embed_text_sha256": "e8cf6e0dd21afcb2b885e1ece646d1ce5b0d4117f2fafa08f3cdb1b7726816d9", "search_text_version": 3, "search_text_sha256": "8a16aedc23b894dc9ceb37b0bc8908460f20c614b9fe9031beb450b7ff749165", "search_text": "DOC: PERA – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).pdf\nTYPE: pdf\nLOC: Page 9\nTAGS: pera, complaint, hearing, hearing officer, process\n\n• Q: What types of violations are punishable under PERA?\nA: PERA covers a range of public offences.

Once an Absolute Order is issued, you are expected to comply within the given timeframe. If you fail to do so, PERA will execute the order: officers will carry out necessary actions (removal, seizure, etc.), and you’ll face fines or other penalties as specified. Essentially, the Absolute Order is the final binding directive after due process (your hearing), and ignoring it has serious consequences.\n\n• Q: Do I have a right to be heard or contest a PERA action?\nA: Yes. PERA’s enforcement system includes provisions for due process. If you’re on the receiving end of an enforcement action (like an EPO or a notice of violation), you generally have the right to file a representation before a Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer is an independent official who will hear your side of the story. During the hearing, you can present evidence or explain your position. The Hearing Officer can then decide to uphold, cancel, or modify the enforcement order (and issue an Absolute Order accordingly). Furthermore, if you disagree with the Hearing Officer’s decision, the law allows you to appeal to higher authorities (first to the divisional Commissioner, and even to a court in second appeal) for redress. In short, while PERA officers can act swiftly to stop violations, the system ensures that citizens have an opportunity to be heard and to appeal decisions – you won’t be punished without a chance to defend yourself.\n\n• Police Involvement and Legal Action\n• Q: Can I be arrested for violating PERA? Will there be a criminal case (FIR)?\nA: Yes, serious violations can lead to arrest and criminal prosecution, though this usually happens in more extreme cases or repeat offenses. The PERA Act explicitly states that all offences under the Act are cognizable and non-bailable, meaning the police can arrest offenders without a warrant and bail is not a right. PERA’s Sub- Divisional Enforcement Officer (SDEO) is empowered to register an FIR (First Information Report) with the police for offences under the Act. In practice, PERA will involve the police if: you continue to defy orders or repeat a violation, if you assault or obstruct an officer, or in any situation where a simple fine or removal action isn’t sufficient to stop the offence.\n\n• Q: What will happen after FIR?\n• For most first-time or minor violations, PERA tries to handle the matter with its own\nnotices, fines, and hearings. But if those measures fail or the offence is of a criminal nature, it escalates to an FIR – at that point, you may be arrested and tried in court (offences under PERA are tried by magistrates). In summary, PERA can and will refer cases to the police when needed. It’s always better to comply with PERA’s directives early on, rather than face an FIR and criminal charges for non- compliance.", "text_sha256": "9b01bfc8ad88e3718a4d404a89be2e15f7cce5435ea228b35565548c5c217bb0", "embedding_model": "text-embedding-3-small", "embed_model_version": 1, "embed_text_version": 4, "embed_text_sha256": "f2eaa06ba6c270a066e5180f8384716b0dfac61aff81a3d6e8c42e3954482bbe", "search_text_version": 3, "search_text_sha256": "3b01a50588b2494cfabec8a91d762ded58b81d629e1b74dc84d0ff995dd57b13", "search_text": "DOC: PERA – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).pdf\nTYPE: pdf\nLOC: Page 10\nTAGS: pera, hearing, hearing officer, appeal, process\n\nfurther penalty for not complying.

In practice, PERA will involve the police if: you continue to defy orders or repeat a violation, if you assault or obstruct an officer, or in any situation where a simple fine or removal action isn’t sufficient to stop the offence.\n\n• Q: What will happen after FIR?\n• For most first-time or minor violations, PERA tries to handle the matter with its own\nnotices, fines, and hearings. But if those measures fail or the offence is of a criminal nature, it escalates to an FIR – at that point, you may be arrested and tried in court (offences under PERA are tried by magistrates). In summary, PERA can and will refer cases to the police when needed. It’s always better to comply with PERA’s directives early on, rather than face an FIR and criminal charges for non- compliance."}

Some specific scenarios include:\n\n• Obstruction or Violence: If someone attacks, threatens, or seriously obstructs a\nPERA enforcement team, an FIR will likely be lodged immediately for obstructing official duties. This ensures the offender can be arrested and the behavior is dealt with under criminal law.\n\n• Repeat or Egregious Violations: If an individual or business keeps flouting the law\n– for example, repeatedly setting up an illegal encroachment after removal, or continuously creating public nuisances, in all such cases, PERA may decide to involve the police. Repeated non-compliance shows intent, and a criminal case can be registered to deter further violations.\n\n• Failure to Comply with Orders: When someone outright refuses to comply with\nan Absolute Order or an EPO (and especially after being given opportunities through notices and hearings), the SDEO can file an FIR to enforce the law. Essentially, if you ignore PERA’s administrative penalties, they will switch to criminal enforcement.\n\n• Other Offences under the Act: Certain violations (like those involving fraud,\nimpersonation, or other criminal behavior) might be handed to police directly. Also, if PERA uncovers a violation of a law outside its immediate scope while enforcing (say, a criminal act under another law), it can coordinate with police to address that.\n\n• In all these cases, PERA works with the police to ensure the offence is prosecuted.\nOnce an FIR is registered, the matter goes into the criminal justice system where the police investigate and the courts adjudicate the offence. Remember, the vast majority of compliance issues won’t reach this stage if you cooperate; FIRs are a last resort for serious breaches of the law.\n\n• Q: What are the consequences if a case is referred to the police?\nA: If your violation gets referred to the police via an FIR, it means the issue has escalated beyond administrative fines. Consequences include: possible arrest, as offences under PERA are cognizable (you can be arrested without warrant). You will have to deal with a criminal case, the police will investigate, and you might have to appear in court. If found guilty by the court, you could face criminal penalties which might include imprisonment or additional fines, depending on the offence (for example, obstructing public servants or other penal code violations carry jail terms). Moreover, having an FIR/court case is itself a hassle – it consumes time and resources, and being non-bailable under the Act means you might not get immediate bail. In short, once a case goes to police, the matter becomes much more serious: your freedom could be at stake aside from just monetary penalties.

Compliance with PERA’s notices and orders early on can prevent such outcomes and keep the matter out of criminal courts.\n\n• Q: How can I report a violation or nuisance to PERA?\nA: If you’re a member of the public wanting to report an issue (like an illegal encroachment in your area or a public nuisance affecting your community), you can file a complaint to PERA. The law allows any aggrieved person or even a concerned bystander to report a public nuisance or encroachment to the Enforcement Officer or relevant PERA office. You may contact your local Enforcement Station (PERA office at the sub-division level) or use any official complaint channels PERA provides (such as a hotline or online portal, if available). When you report, give as many details as possible (location, nature of the problem, people involved, etc.). PERA will then investigate, whereby, PERA official will likely inspect the site, and if the issue falls under PERA’s mandate, they will take action (issuing notices or orders to the offender as described earlier). Reporting is encouraged because it helps the authority identify and address violations that affect the public. There are also whistle-blower protections in the Act – if you report in good faith, your identity can be kept confidential to protect you. Just ensure that the complaint is genuine; knowingly filing a false complaint is itself punishable.\n\n• Q: What are the consequences for a PERA officer if they misuse their authority?\nA: PERA not only enforces rules on the public, but also holds its own officers accountable under the law. If a PERA officer misuses power or acts corruptly, there are provisions to address this. Members of the public can file a grievance or complaint to the Grievance Redressal Commissioner (or the District Board) if they believe an officer has abused their authority. Internally, PERA Act Section 47 makes “misuse of authority by an employee” an offence that can be met with fines (up to Rs. 100,000). In serious cases, the officer could also face departmental disciplinary action or even criminal charges (if laws are broken). PERA officers must act within the law as the system has checks to prevent abuse. This helps ensure that enforcement actions are fair and not personal or arbitrary.
