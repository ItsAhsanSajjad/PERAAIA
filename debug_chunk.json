The HR and Finance Departments ensure that all salary payments are accurate, timely, and as per the sanctioned terms of appointment. 6.2 Annual Salary Increment PERA grants annual salary increments to reward employees for their continued service and to adjust for increased experience and seniority. The policy on annual increments differs slightly for different categories: \u2022 Regular (BPS) Employees & Deputationists: They will be entitled to adhoc increment as announced by Govt. of Punjab in annual budget. Further, annual increment admissible in December will be allowed strictly as per instructions of Govt. of Punjab. | \u2022 Contract Employees: Annual salary increment for contractual employees will be governed in the light of Regulation 16 of PERA (Performance Appraisal) Regulations, 2025. | All increments and pay increases are subject to budget availability and any instructions by the Finance Department. PERA will budget for annual increments as part of its yearly budgeting exercise. | In essence, annual increments serve to reward tenure and adjust pay for increased service. PERA adheres to the standardized approach for regular staff and endeavors to fairly extend similar treatment to contractual staff to maintain equity and motivation across the organization. 6.3 Gratuity The contractual employees of the Authority will be entitled to gratuity equal to one salary at the end of one completed year of their service at PERA. The gratuity at the time of termination of service shall be given to the employee along with his/her final settlement cheque after clearance from all relevant directorate/Departments in accordance with the prescribed exit procedure. An employee who terminates his/her employment or whose employment is terminated by the Authority, for any reason other than misconduct, shall be entitled to gratuity for every completed year of employment or any part thereof in excess of six months. However, payment of gratuity is subject to availability of budget under relevant head.",

PERA\u2019s payroll system will ensure all deductions are transparent and appropriately authorized. The typical deductions that may appear on an employee\u2019s payslip include: \u2022 Income Tax: Salaries are subject to withholding of income tax under the law. PERA, as an employer, will deduct income tax at source from monthly salaries in accordance with prevailing tax rates/slabs notified by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). The tax deduction is computed on the basis of the employee\u2019s projected annual taxable income (salary plus any honoraria etc.) considering applicable exemptions or relief (like taxable income threshold). | \u2022 Provident Fund / Benevolent Fund: For regular and contractual employees, monthly deductions shall be made from their salary as determined by the Authority. These contributions will be credited to the employee\u2019s provident fund or relevant account and payable upon retirement/separation as per applicable rules. The Directorate General retains full discretion to modify deduction rates, contribution structures, or eligibility criteria in accordance with organizational needs and regulatory frameworks. Voluntary additional contributions (if permitted) shall also be governed by the Authority\u2019s prevailing policies. \u2022 Absent or Unpaid Leave Deductions: If an employee had any days of leave without pay or was absent without pay in a month, the proportional salary for those days will be deducted. Decision regarding deduction of salary will be taken by Director General at Directorate level and SDEO at Enforcement Station.",

The categories of employees and their salary determination are as follows: \u2022 Regular Employees (Permanent Staff): PERA\u2019s regular employees are typically governed by the Basic Pay Scales (BPS) system. These employees will be entitled to such PERA Special Pay Package as per service regulations. | \u2022 Deputationists: Deputationists who join PERA will draw the salary and allowances as admissible to them as per Deputation Policy of Govt. of Punjab. | \u2022 Contractual Employees: Contract employees hired under the Special PERA Pay Package (SPPP) may not be on BPS but on lump-sum contract salaries. These salaries could be structured as all-inclusive (no separate allowances, just one consolidated amount) or with certain breakout (like a base pay plus social security benefits etc.), as stated in the contract. Such employees are not eligible for the standard government allowances that regular BPS employees get. However, PERA ensures that contract pay packages are competitive and commensurate with the qualifications and expertise required. \u2022 Pay Days and Mode: Salaries are paid on a monthly basis, typically by the last working day of each month. If that day falls on a weekend or holiday, salaries may be disbursed on the preceding working day. Payment is made via direct bank transfer to the employee\u2019s designated bank account (as per the salary account details provided on joining). | \u2022 Salary during Probation Period: Note that employees on probation receive the same salary as confirmed ones in that grade; probation does not imply a lower salary (only difference is lack of job security initially). \u2022 Salary during Training: Employees of the Authority during induction training will not be entitled to Special PERA Allowance. | In conclusion, PERA strives to maintain equitable pay practices. Regular employees enjoy the security of government scales and benefits, contract employees receive market-aligned",
