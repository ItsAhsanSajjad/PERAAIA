Full answer:
After an arrest under the PERA Act, the following procedures must be followed:

- The **Enforcement Officer** or **Investigation Officer** making the arrest must present the arrested person at the **Enforcement Station** without unnecessary delay.
- They must inform the **Sub Divisional Enforcement Officer (SDEO)** of the arrest and submit a written report for further action.
- The **SDEO** is required to register an **FIR (First Information Report)** immediately and produce the arrested person before a **Magistrate** within **twenty-four hours** of the arrest [2][3]. 

This process ensures that the rights of the arrested individual are upheld and that legal procedures are followed correctly.
