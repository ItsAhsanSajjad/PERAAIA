TC-038: 'After arrest, what must happen next?'
============================================================
Decision: answer
Full answer: After an arrest under the PERA Act, the following steps must occur:

- **Filing of FIR**: The PERA's Sub-Divisional Enforcement Officer (SDEO) is empowered to register a First Information Report (FIR) with the police for offences under the Act if necessary [9].

- **Legal Proceedings**: The arrested individual may face legal proceedings in court, as offences under PERA are cognizable and non-bailable, meaning the police can arrest without a warrant, and bail is not a right [9].

- **Handling of Minor Violations**: For most first-time or minor violations, PERA typically manages the situation with its own notices, fines, and hearings before escalating to an FIR [9].

- **Court Trials**: Serious violations may lead to trial in court, where the case will be heard by magistrates [9].

In summary, the process involves filing an FIR, potential legal proceedings, and handling of the case according to the severity of the violation.
